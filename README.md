# FE Tracking languages
Languages supported by [FE Tracking](https://fe-tracking.fast-events.eu/en/latest/).

## Add a language
1. Make sure you have a  [Github account](https://github.com).
1. Check the *languages* folder of [https://github.com/fe-data/fe-tracking-languages](https://github.com/fe-data/fe-tracking-languages) if your language is supported.
1. If not, login with your Github account at [https://gitlocalize.com/repo/6402](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/6402) and check if the translation is in progress.
1. If not, create a new issue in [https://github.com/fe-data/fe-tracking-languages/issues](https://github.com/fe-data/fe-tracking-languages/issues) requesting the new language code. We will give you the role of moderator for the new language. Use the two letter codes from [this source](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php). Only LTR-languages are supported.

## Pull requests
As a moderator you may receive review requests from other translators. Process them and when you are happy with the update, create a pull request.
Mind you: 

1. We will only process pull requests that originate from Gitlocalize and will not process pull requests from private forks.
1. For initial translations, we will only accept a full translation of the entire file. Partial translations will be rejected.
1. Once the pull request has been processed, the new translation will be available in the app’s settings. Reload the translations and select the new language.
1. There is only 1 moderator per language.
