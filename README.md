# FE Tracking languages
Languages supported by [FE Tracking](https://fe-tracking.fast-events.eu/en/latest/).

## Add a languages
Check the languages folder if your language is supported. If the language is not supported you can add a language yourself. Take the following steps:

1. Make sure you have a  Github account
1. Login with the Github account at [https://gitlocalize.com/repo/6402](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/6402)
1. Create a new issue in [https://github.com/fe-data/fe-tracking-languages/issues](https://github.com/fe-data/fe-tracking-languages/issues) requesting the new language code. We will give you the role of moderator for the new language. Use the two letter codes from [this source](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php). Only LTR-languages are supported.

## Pull requests
As moderator you may receive review requests from other translators. Process them and when you are happy with the update create a pull request.
Mind you: 

1. We will only process pull request which origin from Gitlocalize and no pull requests from private forks
1. For initial translations we only accept a full translation of the whole file. Partial translations will be rejected.
1. Once we have processed the pull request, the translation will be available for the App within 15 minutes if you re-install the App. If you don't re-install the App it may take up to 12 hoours before the App is aware of the new language.
