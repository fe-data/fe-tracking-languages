# FE Tracking languages
Languages supported by [FE Tracking](https://fe-tracking.fast-events.eu/en/latest/).

## Add a language
Check the languages folder to see if your language is supported. If the language is not supported you can add a language yourself. Follow the steps below:

1. Make sure you have a  Github account
1. Sign in with your Github account at [https://gitlocalize.com/repo/9558](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/9558)
1. Create a new issue in [https://github.com/fe-data/fe-tracking-languages/issues](https://github.com/fe-data/fe-tracking-languages/issues) requesting the new language code. We will give you the role of moderator for the new language. Use the two letter codes from [this source](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php). Only LTR-languages are supported.

## Pull requests
As a moderator you may receive review requests from other translators. Process them and when you are happy with the update, create a pull request.
Mind you: 

1. We will only process pull requests that originate from Gitlocalize and will not process pull requests from private forks.
1. For initial translations, we will only accept a full translation of the entire file. Partial translations will be rejected.
1. Once we have processed the pull request, the translation will be available to the App within 15 minutes if you re-install the App. If you don't re-install the App, it can take up to 12 hours for the App to recognize the new language.
